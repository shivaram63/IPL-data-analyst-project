# 🏏 IPL Data Analyst Case Study

A complete end-to-end IPL Data Analysis project using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), SQL (MySQL), Power BI, and Excel**.

## 📁 Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- MySQL for SQL Queries
- Microsoft Power BI for Dashboards
- MS Excel (Pivot Tables)
- Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

## 📊 What I Did:
- Cleaned and analyzed IPL match and ball-by-ball datasets
- Performed EDA on players, teams, toss, seasons, scores, economy, etc.
- Wrote over 30+ SQL queries to find top batters, bowlers, match outcomes
- Built an interactive Power BI Dashboard
- Created visualizations using matplotlib in Python

## 🔍 Key Insights:
- Top teams with most wins
- Top 10 run scorers and wicket takers
- Toss impact on match outcomes
